go-selenium-proxy
=================
Alternative to browsermob-proxy written in go.

Eventually should have the final features:
- Create new proxies
- Serve HAR files for each created proxy 
- Remap hosts to different ips / host names

That's it for now. Hopefully i'll hack this along in the coming weeks.
